# Learning Python
Compilation of projects I do to learn Python. Based on [this.](https://github.com/karan/Projects)
## List of Projects
1. Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.

2. Coin Flip Simulation - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of 
tails and heads.

3. Pig Latin - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the 
end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay).

4. Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

5. Change Return Program - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies 
needed for the change.

6. Calculator - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.

7. Distance Between Two Cities - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the 
cities like latitude and longitude.

8. Check if Palindrome - Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

9. Collatz Conjecture - Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 
and add 1.

10. Find PI to the Nth Digit - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

11. Next Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.

12. Fizz Buzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For 
numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

13. Count Words in a String - Counts the number of individual words in a string. For added complexity read these strings in from a text file and generate a summary.

14. Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more) - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want 
to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.

15. Number Names - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million

16. Quiz Maker - Make an application which takes various questions from a file, picked randomly, and puts together a quiz for students. Each quiz can be different and then reads a 
key to grade the quizzes.

17. Vigenere / Vernam / Ceasar Ciphers - Functions for encrypting and decrypting data messages. Then send them to a friend.

18. Sorting - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

19. Binary to Decimal and Back Converter - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.

20. Graphical Text Editor - Notepad style application that can open, edit, and save text documents. Add syntax highlighting and other features.

21. Graphical Calculator

22. Any game
